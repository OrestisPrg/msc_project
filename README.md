This repository contains the software models desinged and implemented for the project "Explainable Machine Learning for Outcome Prediction of Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment by Flow Diverters" of my master's degree on "Advanced Computer Science with AI".

The project is research-driven and studies interpretable machine learning for the medical domain. It aims at examining approaches and methods for interpreting black-box machine learning models in order to produce constructive predictions that can be trusted by medical experts. The software implementations demonstrate the concept of introducing or exploiting explainability to different machine learning models.

This repository contains four notebooks, each of which implements a Machine Learning model, as well as the dataset which they used for the purpose of the project. The dataset exists in its modified version (post data preparation and proessing) and is ready to be used with the models.

To use the notebooks, it is recomended to download the notebook and upload it on Google Colab. The notebooks should run on other Jupyter notebook environments but Google Colab is recommended since the notebooks have been implemented and tested in said environment.

To use the dataset provided, please upload the "primary_features.csv" file in Colab's runtime environment to be used with the desired model.
